/* 
Cloneable interface : Cloneable interface is present in java.lang package. There is a method clone() in Object class. A class that implements the Cloneable interface indicates that it is legal for clone() method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class. 
Invoking Objectâ€™s clone method on an instance of the class that does not implement the Cloneable interface results in an exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown. By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone() method.
