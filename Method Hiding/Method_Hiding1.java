/*
- When a child class defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the parent class, then the childâ€™s method hides the one in the parent class. 

- If a subclass defines a static method with the same signature as a static method in the superclass, then the method in the subclass hides the one in the superclass. 
- This mechanism happens because the static method is resolved at the compile time. Static method bind during the compile time using the type of reference not a type of object.
