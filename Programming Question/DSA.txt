Time Complexity
- Overall Running time depends on multiple factors
    - Logic/ Agro 
    - Language : c/c++/ java fast as compare to python & JS
    - Operating i3   & m1 pro


Def : no of operations  as a function of inputs. (Asymptotic analysis)

Types of Time Complexity analysis and thier Notation
- Worst Case time Complexity (Big O  O(n))
- Best Case time Complexity (Big omega omega(1))
- Average Case time Complexity (Big theta theta(n))
